Build a production-quality frontend-only wellbeing web application called MyWellbeingToday, owned by Wellbeing@Fingertip and built by Airfns Softwares.

This project is a dedicated FRONTEND application only.
Do NOT create any backend, server, database, authentication logic, or API implementations.
This project must focus entirely on UI, UX, routing, state structure, and user flows.

This frontend will later connect to a separate backend via REST APIs.
