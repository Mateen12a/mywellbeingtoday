Design the FRONTEND AI experience and interaction layer for the wellbeing web application MyWellbeingToday, owned by Wellbeing@Fingertip and built by Airfns Softwares.

This task is FRONTEND ONLY.
Do NOT implement backend logic, AI engines, databases, or API servers.

The goal is to design and build the AI-driven user experience, flows, screens, and data structures so that real AI services can be connected later without refactoring the UI.

AI is a CORE FEATURE and must feel native to the product, not an add-on.

GLOBAL RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Frontend communicates with AI ONLY via REST API calls (mocked for now)
- No AI logic runs in the browser
- No AI providers are hardcoded
- All AI responses are mocked safely in the frontend
- Mock responses must follow real-world AI response shapes
- No runtime errors if backend or AI is unavailable

AI UX RESPONSIBILITIES (FRONTEND)

The frontend must present AI as a trusted wellbeing assistant that supports:
- Activity tracking
- Symptom awareness
- Wellbeing analysis
- Guidance and recommendations
- Planning and insights

The AI must never:
- Claim medical diagnosis
- Use fear-based language
- Use the word “simple”

AI INTERACTION SURFACES (REQUIRED)

1. DAILY ACTIVITY & SYMPTOM INPUT (AI-AWARE UI)

Design interfaces where users can:
- Log daily activities manually
- Trigger voice entry (UI only)
- Record physical and mental experiences
- Select context (work, home, travel, school, leisure)
- Record sleep, stress, conflicts, mood

Frontend must:
- Structure this data exactly as it would be sent to an AI API
- Timestamp entries
- Prepare payloads for analysis

2. AI ANALYSIS RESULTS DISPLAY

Design UI components to display AI outputs including:
- Wellbeing classification:
  - Asymptomatic
  - Mild
  - Moderate
  - Severe
- Confidence or clarity indicators
- Calm explanatory summaries
- Visual status indicators (icons, colour states)

All AI outputs are mocked but must feel real and consistent.

3. MOOD TRACKER (AI-INFORMED UI)

Design a mood tracker that:
- Reflects AI analysis results
- Accepts wearable data placeholders
- Degrades gracefully if wearables are not connected
- Updates dashboards and daily summaries

Mood states must influence:
- Dashboard highlights
- Decision prompts
- Guidance visibility

4. AI DECISION & GUIDANCE FLOW

When symptoms are detected, the UI must:
- Show severity clearly
- Present AI-recommended next steps
- Offer actions such as:
  - Monitor wellbeing
  - Learn more
  - Seek professional help

Recommendations must:
- Feel supportive and non-alarming
- Be location-aware in structure (even if mocked)
- Respect user choice and consent

5. WELLBEING PLAN UI

Design AI-driven wellbeing plan views that:
- Show daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly plans
- Present steps, reminders, and guidance
- Can be downloaded or printed (UI only)
- Are structured for future real AI content

6. AI SEARCH & KNOWLEDGE EXPERIENCE

Design an AI-assisted search interface where users can:
- Ask about symptoms or activities
- Learn recommended actions
- Understand wellbeing impacts

Responses must:
- Be calm and inclusive
- Avoid diagnosis language
- Be adaptable by persona and context

7. AGGREGATE INSIGHTS (FRONTEND VIEW)

Design UI views for:
- Monthly, quarterly, yearly wellbeing insights
- Community or organisational trends
- Research and policy dashboards

Data must be presented as:
- Fully anonymised
- Aggregated summaries
- Mocked but realistic

8. CERTIFICATION SUPPORT UI

Design frontend flows for:
- Viewing AI-assisted summaries
- Supporting wellbeing or medical certification processes
- Viewing renewal history

AI assists with summaries only. No certification claims.

PERSONA-AWARE UI DESIGN

The AI experience must adapt visually and textually for:
- Individual citizens of all ages
- Employees and workplaces
- Event participants
- Residents at home or on journeys
- Community and population-level views

Tone must always be:
- Calm
- Respectful
- Confidence-building
- Accessible regardless of technical skill

SECURITY & ETHICS (FRONTEND)

- Display clear disclaimers
- Respect privacy boundaries
- Require consent confirmations where relevant
- Never imply diagnosis or treatment

API READINESS (FRONTEND ONLY)

Prepare API service files such as:
- analyzeDailyLog()
- generateWellbeingPlan()
- recommendActions()
- fetchAggregateInsights()

All API calls must:
- Use mock responses for now
- Be isolated in a services layer
- Be easy to switch to real backend endpoints later

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Produce:
- Fully designed AI-aware frontend UI
- Mock AI responses with real-world structure
- Clean component architecture
- Clear separation between UI, state, and API services
- No backend code
- No AI provider logic

Do NOT explain steps.
Do NOT generate backend code.
Do NOT hardcode AI engines.
Design the AI experience exactly as specified so it can later connect to real AI services without UI changes.
